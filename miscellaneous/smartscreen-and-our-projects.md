SmartScreen may detect that our project's executables may not pass the SmartScreen attestation. If this happens, you'll see the below page:

Our projects will not put your PC at risk (except if you downloaded a copy from an unofficial software distributor, or from an unofficial source other than our official releases, our Chocolatey package, and our NuGet package). Click on `More Info`, then click on `Run anyways`.
