# Support Periods

When a library is released, it typically comes with just one version series, which is typically 1.x or 0.1.x. Only eligible projects can have their own support period for all versions in the series.

***

## <mark style="color:$primary;">Version legend</mark>

The version legend is used in the changelogs for every single version that was released, when the version series is under support:

* <mark style="color:green;">**Green**</mark>: Indicates additions
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Yellow**</mark>: Indicates improvements
* <mark style="color:red;">**Red**</mark>: Indicates removals
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Purple**</mark>: Indicates something else

***

## <mark style="color:$primary;">General support cadence</mark>

In general, projects that are eligible for support periods can follow this guide:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### <mark style="color:$primary;">Projects that reached 1.x or later</mark>

As soon as the new 1.x version series starts, such as Terminaux 7.0.x to 8.0.x, the support period ending will be assigned immediately under the following:

* One-year window is applied to projects that get updated frequently.
* Two-year window is applied to projects that get updated less frequently.
* Three-year window is applied to projects that get updated occasionally in an unplanned schedule.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### <mark style="color:$primary;">Projects that are in the 0.x.y series</mark>

As soon as the new 0.x.y version series starts, such as Nitrocid 0.1.0 to 0.1.1, the support period ending will be assigned immediately under the following:

* Nine-month window is applied to projects that get updated frequently.
* One-year window is applied to projects that get updated less frequently.
* Two-year window is applied to projects that get updated occasionally in an unplanned schedule.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### <mark style="color:$primary;">Projects that are in the 0.0.x.y series</mark>

There is no support for these versions except the latest version, which won't last long. As soon as the library or the application moves to the 0.x.y series or the x.y.z series, none of the 0.0.x.y series will be in support.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="info" %}
When a beta version of a specific version series is announced, the beta versions are supported through the lifetime of the testing period until the first public release of the version, after which all beta versions expire.

For example, Nitrocid KS 0.0.6 had a beta testing period that lasted 6 versions (0.0.5.9 -> 0.0.5.14) until the first public release.
{% endhint %}

***

## <mark style="color:$primary;">Exceptions</mark>

Applications and libraries may have exceptions that deviate from the general support plan shown above.

The following projects that were given exceptions are here:

{% step %}
### <mark style="color:$primary;">Nitrocid</mark>

The following release support terms are divided into two sections:

* **Short term releases**: 9 months for each minor release (such as 0.1.1 and 0.1.2)
* **Long term releases**: 5 years of non-security fixes and 5 years of security and critical fixes for each major release (such as 0.1.0 and 0.2.0)

You can consult the supported versions list [here](https://app.gitbook.com/s/yhORwVwuIgJMLsQRqN3S/versions-and-compatibility/supported-versions).
{% endstep %}
