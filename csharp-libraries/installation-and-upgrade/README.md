# Installation and Upgrade

The most reliable (and the only officially supported) way to install and to upgrade our libraries in your .NET application or library, regardless of which language you're working on (C#, F#, Visual Basic, and so on), is to use NuGet.org as the _only_ official source. Each and every single library (like [Terminaux](https://app.gitbook.com/o/fj052nYlsxW9IdL3bsZj/s/G0KrE9Uk2AiblqjWtpAo/)), application that provides extension support (like [Nitrocid KS](https://app.gitbook.com/o/fj052nYlsxW9IdL3bsZj/s/yhORwVwuIgJMLsQRqN3S/)), or an application-library hybrid (like [BassBoom](https://app.gitbook.com/o/fj052nYlsxW9IdL3bsZj/s/izAJoIbtQw1BdIlE4DBz/)), can be installed as a NuGet package.

{% hint style="info" %}
This requires an active Internet connection to proceed. If you'd like to use your local NuGet feed, upload the appropriate packages to your feed first so that all machines that use your feed will be able to download packages from that feed. Consult [this page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/hosting-packages/overview) for more information on how to host our libraries in your feed.
